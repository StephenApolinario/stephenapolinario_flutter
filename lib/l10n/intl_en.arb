As a child, I would take my toys apart to try to understand how each component contributed to their function. Over time, this curiosity grew into a passion for programming, and finally led me to pursue a degree in Computer Engineering, where I was able to deepen my technical and theoretical knowledge.",

  "museo_summary": "Digital Audio Guide application for mobile devices integrated with Bluetooth beacons located in museums. It guides visitors through tours while providing detailed speech synthesized descriptions of the exhibits.\n\nKey features include the ability to comment on artworks, allowing users to add artworks to favorites, control the guide's audio, earn badges based on quiz scores and analyze their performance.\n\nThe system consists of three applications: one for users with core functionalities, another for museum administrators for configuration, and a Restful NodeJS API that bridges these systems and can be extended for future integration with others systems.",
  "museo_role": "As the only programmer, I had the opportunity to work on all stages of development, including the creation of the user application, the administrator application and the API.",
  "museo_team": "I worked together with a designer who created the prototype of the application, allowing me to concentrate exclusively on programming, without having to worry about front-end design.",
  "museo_project_purpose": "This project was my final submission for my computer engineering degree. I proposed a digital guide application and a wireless communication system aimed at enhancing museum interactions for visually impaired visitors while providing a user-friendly experience for the general public. The app functions as a guide that activates when visitors approach points of interest, narrating stored information based on selected tours. Additionally, an administrative app enables museum staff to register points of interest for activation and manage quizzes, tours, other administrators, and emblems.\n\nThe client for this project is the Oceanographic Museum Univali (MOVI), the largest oceanographic museum in the Americas and the third largest globally in its field, housing one of Brazil's top four historical collections.",
  "museo_spotlight": "The standout feature of this project was undoubtedly its Bluetooth integration. This capability brought it to life, enabling an integration with real museums. This was made possible through beacon devices and the Flutter package flutter_blue_plus, allowing the application to detect nearby Bluetooth devices and initiate specific actions, like describing artwork, starting quizzes, presentations, and more.\n\nAnother great functionality is the quizzes, which are highly beneficial for helping visitors retain the acquired knowledge. It also incorporates gamification by allowing users to earn emblems based on their score.",
  "museo_lessons": "I learned a lot from this project, such as integrating multiple systems into one cohesive unit and delving into Bluetooth functionalities, such as establishing connections and effective data handling techniques.\n\nThis was my first Flutter project, there are undoubtedly several areas requiring refactoring, and some features are missing, especially in the backend of the ticket and souvenir store. However, succeeding in solving a real problem was deeply satisfying, and the experience gained with Flutter was invaluable.",

  "courses_summary": "A personal project with the goal to centralize all my courses from different platforms in one place. To do this, specific Python scripts were used for each platform, with the ability to read the screen and search for titles, summaries, videos, images and files. The project is structured around these Python scripts, using Laravel for both the backend and the frontend, hosted on AWS EC2, with image and file storage for download on AWS S3.",
  "courses_project_purpose": "The motivation for this project came from an experience where I lost access to a course because the author decided to remove the content. To prevent this from happening again, I decided to create a platform that would protect against losing access to content when it's removed or becomes unavailable on the original platform. This project provides long-term storage and consolidates multiple courses from different platforms in one place, making them easier to organize and manage.",
  "courses_spotlight": "The core of this project is the use of Python scripts to extract data from a variety of web pages. Selenium was used strategically to address specific scenarios, such as browsing pages with dynamic content and performing automated interactions with user interfaces. For other pages, scrapping was performed using libraries such as Requests and BeautifulSoup to ensure efficient data extraction from static HTML content. This hybrid approach allows the project to identify information across multiple platforms, optimizing data retrieval.",
  "courses_lessons": "This project gave me a valuable understanding of web scraping methodologies, where I learned techniques for extracting data from websites. I acquired the skills to interact with JavaScript content and automate processes. I also expanded my experience working with AWS EC2 and S3, deepening my knowledge of cloud computing infrastructure and storage solutions.",
